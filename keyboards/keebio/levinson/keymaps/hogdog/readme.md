# TODO
* [X] add "ls -ahl" button
* [X] tweak tap / hold settings
  * turned on permissive hold and ignore mod tap interrupt (if you let go of tap modifier before you let go of next key it does both as taps)
* add / install underglow
* add button for clipit shortcut
* decide on whether to have two shift keys or a shift and a control (I think control is probably better on the left)
* should the layer keys be tap layers?
  * maybe make the four taps: tab - space -- backspace - enter?
  * or use: enter space -- backspace del?
